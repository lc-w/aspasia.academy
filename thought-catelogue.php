Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, who I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear.

                    <h1>Thought Notes</h1>
                    <p>Writing is a valuable tool to clarify your thoughts and understand your feelings on your work. Taking the time to write each day not only leaves you with a history of your ideas but creates a space for the evolution your thinking. </p>
                    <p>Use this space to write with no particular intention, as soon you will find the intention reveals itself.</p>
