            <h1>Aspasia Academy </h1>
            <p>is a multi-media platform that uses virtual reality, online, and social media to allow women to share their stories of autonomy, feminism, entrepreneurship, artistic creation and technological learning. This idea came into being after putting on a pair of virtual reality goggles. Working in this virtual world was such a thrill; with so much potential for sharing stories and collaboration. There is so much to understand through a direct learned experience, and sometimes its harder than you think to find a mentor or teacher in your reach. This platform is a place where women can share ideas, connecting students to mentors. And most importantly it allows women to share their creative experiences together from around the world.</p>
