            <h1>Creative Practicing</h1>
            <p>One doesn’t arrive — in words or in art — by necessarily knowing where one is going. In every work of art something appears that does not previously exist, and so, by default, you work from what you know to what you don’t know.</p>
            <p>The responsibility of the artist, is the practice of recognizing.</p>
            <p>A life of making isn’t a series of shows, or projects, or productions, or things: it is an everyday practice. It is a practice of questions more than answers, of waiting to find what you need more often than knowing what you need to do.<br><i>- Ann Hamilton</i></p>

            <h1>On Creation</h1>
            <p>The monster I kill every day is the monster of realism. The monster who attacks me every day is destruction. Out of the duel comes the transformation. I turn destruction into creation over and over again. <i>- Anaïs Nin</i></p>

            <h1>On Reading</h1>
            <p>Nearly every book has the same architecture — cover, spine, pages — but you open them onto worlds and gifts far beyond what paper and ink are, and on the inside they are every shape and power. Some books are toolkits you take up to fix things, from the most practical to the most mysterious, from your house to your heart, or to make things, from cakes to ships...They can be doorways and ships and fortresses for anyone who loves them. <i>- Rebecca Solnit</i></p>
